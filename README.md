The intended web-application helps administrators (AD) advertising and managing the products and facilitates customers (CU) place their orders. The designed  web-application  is  based on the  caf√©-bar system. Both CU and AD can access the index page. However, AD will be able to do products management functionalities such as add, edit or delete items. Through the specific hyperlinks generated for each functionality, AD will be able to add, update and removing items. On the other hand, CU accessibility will be limited to the menu page. The shopping process will be consisted of few steps. First, through the menu icon at the main page, CU will be able to go through the displayed items of drinks and food. In addition, CU will be able to see only the items that are in stock since the application will automatically delete any product out of stock. Secondly, CU can add the chosen products of the preferred food or drink to the shopping basket or the cart. The application will automatically display the required items in the shopping basket. The price and the ordered quantity of each item will be clearly displayed too. The application will confirm to the CU once the order is completed and successfully submitted.
